# Weather-Dashboard

## Decription

This application is used for searching current and future weather conditions in a city of your choice. Users can enter a city name in the input field, hit search, and see the current weather conditions as well as a 5-day future forecast for the area. This site also keeps track of search history so users can easily switch between cities.

It's important to be aware of the weather when heading out into the world. This site retreives current and future weather forecast data so users will be prepared for whatever weather is affecting their area.

Making this site helped me become more familiar with writing API fetch requests and manipulating the data returned by those requests. I was also able to practice using third-party CSS frameworks by using bootstrap for the site's styling.
